# Big-Open-Source-Math-Book

The Big Open Source Math Book (BOSMB) is a compilation of all of the lesson plans I've ever written as a teacher of high school mathematics, and hten some.

Each lesson plan is contained within its own folder. There is one master file that uses the `combine` package that will collect each one of these lessons into a silgle file.

I need to proof read each file so that it's not as specific to my class as it is. I also aim to rewrite all of the diagrams so that they're no longer image files, but drawn with `tikz`.

The last thing I need to do is create more chapter sections for things that I glossed over or used other resouces for teaching (mostly graphing). This way it will be an all inclusive book without the need for any other.
